## The Burger Bar ##

The Burger Bar demonstrates a simple full stack application.  The front-end is implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from Bootstrap framework and the backend is implemented with Node.js and Express. MySql is used for database and HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

## Instructions ## 

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed in the card on the left of the screen. The user may then eat the burger by clicking on the button next to its name. The button click will move the burger into the adjacent card and will also update its status accordingly in the MySql database.
